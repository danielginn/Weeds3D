## Steps:

# 1. Import video

# 2. Identify all frames with red balls on white sticks

# 3. Identify the center frame for each red ball

# 4a. Shorter output: return x number of frames before and after red ball

# 4b. Approximate elevation angle of camera from diameter of each red ball

# 5. Calculate average path trajectory for each red ball

# 6. Project average path trajectory for each red ball down to ground level

# 7. Approximate ground region of biomass sampling

# 8. Longer output: determine which frames should be passed to Structure-from-Motion for each red ball


## Data:
# What data do I need over the entire process?
# Video:
#   - video filepath
#   - frames
#   - red ball center frames
#
# Frame:
#   - image
#   - frame number
#   - elevation angle estimate
#   - Red balls
#       - center
#           - x
#           - y
#       - radius
#       - gravity vector 2d
#   - biomass region prediction
